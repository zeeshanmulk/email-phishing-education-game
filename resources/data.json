    "Malware, which is short for malicious software, can be a file or a piece of code, which is typically delivered over a network, that can infect, steal, explore or perform any behaviour an attacker wants. A malware compromised device may be used by an attacker to gain control of the device, steal sensitive information, explore other devices on the network, or infect other devices.",
    "Social engineering is tricking a user using psychological manipulation to give away sensitive or personal information. Remember, humans are very trusting and wants to help out by default. Attackers can exploit that for example to obtain credentials to compromise a company asset which can lead to deployment of ransomware or data breach. Both are very damaging to the company.",
    "Email phishing is when attackers impersonate a legitimate organization via email which is designed to steal information. The emails can convey a sense of urgency and is typically about password resets, account hack notifications, payment notifications, etc. Users are tricked to give away sensitive information on a fake website that can lead to account compromise, malware installation, data breaches, etc. Did you know that phishing is responsible for 90% of security breaches?",
    "Business email compromise (BEC) is type of an email scam where attackers impersonate a legitimate employee or business partner, and make seemingly legitimate request to disclose sensitive information or perform actions that benefit the attackers financially.",
    "Ransomware, which is all the rage recently, 2022 as of writing this, is a type of malware that encrypts the whole system drive or user's personal files and folders with a key/password. In either cases, access to the computer or user's files is restricted with some sort of ransom message. For large corporations, there is usually some contact information for ransom negotiation. Some ransom groups even have 24/7 support channel! Once a payment has been received, the key/password is provided and the assets can be decrypted.",
    "Cybersecurity tries to protect Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA). Confidentiality is ensuring data is only available to the authorized person or process, Integrity is ensuring data can only be modified by an authorised person or process, Availability is ensuring data is accessible to authorised person or process. Compromising any of the triad is a security incident.",
    "Your company has great policies for good security practices. For example, never plug in a USB to your workstation. Don't violate NDAs. Don't leave your workstation unlocked, and many more. If you need to know more, ask your team lead for more information."
