    "Malware, which is short for malicious software, can be a file or a piece of code, which is typically delivered over a network, that can infect, steal, explore or perform any behaviour an attacker wants. A malware compromised device may be used by an attacker to gain control of the device, steal sensitive information, explore other devices on the network, or infect other devices.",
    "Social engineering is tricking a user using psychological manipulation to give away sensitive or personal information. Remember, humans, are very trusting and want to help out by default. Attackers can exploit that for example to obtain credentials to compromise Softwaregenix's asset which can lead to the deployment of ransomware or data breach. Both are very damaging to Softwaregenix.",
    "Email phishing is when attackers impersonate a legitimate organization via email which is designed to steal information. The emails can convey a sense of urgency and is typically about password resets, account hack notifications, payment notifications, etc. Users are tricked to give away sensitive information on a fake website that can lead to account compromise, malware installation, data breaches, etc. Did you know that phishing is responsible for 90% of security breaches?",
    "Spear phishing is when the attacker targets a specific individual or group of individuals rather than a generic user base via email. Emails are personalized with the recipient's name, company, phone number, etc. This technique usually takes time for the attacker to prepare as it requires gathering data from various sources.",
    "Business email compromise (BEC) is a type of email scam where attackers impersonate a legitimate employee or business partner and make a seemingly legitimate request to disclose sensitive information or perform actions that benefit the attackers financially.",
    "Ransomware, which is all the rage recently, 2022 as of writing this, is a type of malware that encrypts the whole system drive or user's personal files and folders with a key/password. In either case, access to the computer or user's files is restricted with some sort of ransom message. For large corporations, there is usually some contact information for ransom negotiation. Some ransom groups even have a 24/7 support channel! Once payment has been received, the key/password is provided and the assets can be decrypted.",
    "Cybersecurity tries to protect Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA). Confidentiality is ensuring data is only available to the authorized person or process, Integrity is ensuring data can only be modified by an authorized person or process, Availability is ensuring data is accessible to authorized person or process. Compromising any of the triads is a security incident.",
    "There are often blatantly obvious indicators of a phishing or spear-phishing email. 1. The address from which it was sent will be fake, for example, if the email is impersonating Netflix, it can be from john@gmail.com, or can have typos that are easy to miss, for example, NitFlix. Legit company correspondence will use their domain name. It may use the same logos as the company it's claiming to be from. 2. The email can have unprofessional greetings like, \"Hi Dear\", \"Greetings\", \"Dear Sir/Madam\" etc. Legit communication will likely address you by your name. 3. It may have several spelling mistakes in the subject and the body of the email. Needless to say, this will not be the case for legit communications. They know how to spell! 4. It will almost always include a link and invite you to click to solve the problem the email is addressing and request sensitive information. You will rarely be asked to share sensitive information over email by legit companies. If you hover over the link, it might be something unrecognizable. 5. It can have strange unexpected attachments. Legit companies will never send unsolicited attachments your way. Check out the 7 ways to recognize a phishing email in the reference section from which this blurb of information was based on.",
    "The impact of a successful malware infiltration into a company network such as ours is at first, financial. This could be a direct loss of capital that the attackers might have stolen, or fines to various regulatory organizations, like GDPR, PIPEDA, HIPAA, etc. It could also be from compensating customers due to a data breach. The second impact is the loss of intellectual properties, which are sensitive business information. While it's possible to recover from a financial loss, it's difficult to recover from the loss of intellectual properties as this is what gives Softwaregenix a competitive edge over our competitors. The third impact is damage to company reputation. If our clients lose our trust, they will not be inclined to do business with us in the future. We might go out of business!",
    "As per company policy, you should use your Softwaregenix email only for business communications. Please do not use it for personal reasons such as sign up for an Amazon account with it. Use your personal email instead for non-business needs. In addition, don't forget as per company policy, if you are sending sensitive information regarding your work, please encrypt it using AES, and send it as an attachment using your Softwaregenix email. Never use your personal email to send sensitive information.",
    "As per company policy, you are prohibited to use your personal web-based email while on the Softwaregenix network. Please use your personal smart device instead for checking the next shipment of your Amazon order!"
